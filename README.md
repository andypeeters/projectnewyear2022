# New Year's Project 2022

The idea was to create a small python script that would send New Year's wishes at pre-defined timestamps via my Twitter account. The script was supposed to run in a docker container.

Alas, Twitter requires a phone number assigned to an account before developer API access can be granted to that account. At this moment I have no intention to do just that as I'm having more and more issues with the unlimited data collection frenzy of any social media platform.

Perhaps in the future I might change my mind but the project has ended for now.
